# awesome-docfx

Curated list of DocFX resources

This list aims to become part of the https://awesome.re family at some point. It is yet work-in-progress, where we add useful DocFX-related links so that we can easily find them when needed.

## The platform

- [DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx). Version 2 is currently the stable version (note that versions >= 2.52 [does not work properly on macOS and Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/5785); use version 2.51 to be on the safe side.

## Examples of projects using DocFX to publish their documentation

- [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com). Unfortunately, the infrastructure they use for building their site (apart from DocFX, which is indeed a critical part) is not currently free software, so it's hard to "look at learn" at how they are using DocFX more specifically.
- [Npgsql](http://npgsql.org/), source available at https://github.com/npgsql/doc
